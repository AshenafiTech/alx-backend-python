# Python Testing with `unittest`

This project focuses on writing unit tests using Pythonâ€™s built-in `unittest` framework along with tools like `parameterized` and `unittest.mock`. The goal is to test utility functions and client behaviors effectively by applying testing best practices such as mocking, parameterization, and fixtures.

## ðŸ§ª Whatâ€™s Covered

- Unit vs. Integration testing
- Mocking readonly properties and API calls
- Parameterized tests using `parameterized.expand`
- Writing tests for functions using nested dictionaries
- Using fixtures for structured test data
- Applying memoization and testing cache-aware behavior
